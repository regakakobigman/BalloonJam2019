Not even the good kind, just the low-quality wispy stuff that leaves you with a wavering high. Your helium dealer just overdosed and floated away, which snapped you out of your addiction and led to you re-evaluating your situation.
	
	Conveniently, you have exactly $1.00 left. And there's a balloon shop just down the road. It's time to start anew, one böllöön at a time."""
