# These functions provide string descriptions for items

func get_no_description() -> String:
	return ""

func get_air_freshener_description() -> String:
	return "It's latex scented."

func get_carrot_description() -> String:
	return "Hey, Beckett likes his carrots. You have no right to judge. The man likes his eyesight."

func get_expired_seat_belt_description() -> String:
	return "It's past its expiration date and starting to lose its flavor. But balloons can't drive, so you don't care."

func get_expired_soda_description() -> String:
	return "It's not the soda that's expired, it's the can. The soda is fine, but the can's corn husk wrapper is starting to get mouldy. I swear the store brand sodas always go first."

func get_expired_soy_sauce_packet_description() -> String:
	return "A collector's item. There's a comic on the inside, but the punchline is only visible if you fold the wrapper into a swan."

func get_fridge_description() -> String:
	return "The fridges don't get very cold at all, but each one is smaller than the last. You have to nest them like Matryoshka dolls to adjust the temperature."

func get_gallon_of_moisturizer_description() -> String:
	return "It's why balloons always have perfect skin. Once they outgrow their shells, they need to moisturize to stay pristine."

func get_horse_description() -> String:
	return "They're really small, but it's rumored that their fangs have the strongest venom of all the arachnids."

func get_leg_warmer_description() -> String:
	return "They may look warm, but they're actually shaped like a hypertorus so they keep falling off."

func get_mop_description() -> String:
	return "They're double bladed, so they can only be wielded by a master mopper."

func get_outlet_description() -> String:
	return "They're just solid copper bricks with some uninsulated wires and tape. Makes it a lot easier to plug stuff in."

func get_pound_of_beef_description() -> String:
	return "It's actually been shaped into beef aerogel, so one pound is the size of an entire room. Still tastes good. The beef tends to shatter when you bite down on it, though."

func get_shovel_description() -> String:
	return "Each shovel is secretly a balloon animal, but don't tell anyone."

func get_sidewalk_slab_description() -> String:
	return "It's rude to make Earth hold up all those slabs, so the ethics board voted to fill the slabs with balloons to lighten the load. It almost works, but sometimes a big balloon pops and launches a slab into the air. Lot of property damage."

func get_styrofoam_flower_description() -> String:
	return "They're really light, so they're a great gift for a balloon on Valentine's Day. Firing Cupid's arrow used to be a tradition, but it caused a lot of casualties, so it was recently banned."

func get_tooth_pick_description() -> String:
	return "There's only one tooth pick in existence. You just keep buying and selling the same copy of it to an amnesiac Nigerian prince. I didn't program it so you can only have one, so just pretend like that's a thing."
